## Installation

    git clone --recursive https://github.com/bentruyman/dotfiles.git \
     && cd dotfiles \
     && source bootstrap.sh

## Usage

These dotfiles add/configure the following:

- emacs/spacemacs
- go
- iTerm2
- macOS
- node/nvm
- tmux
- zsh

The above list is not exhaustive of the programs installed as part of these
dotfiles. Please review the programs installed in the
[init](https://github.com/bentruyman/dotfiles/tree/master/init) directory.

### Directories

This dotfiles repository contains several directories. Below are
descriptions for the intention/purpose for each of them.

#### `/backups`

When running `bootstrap.sh`, any conflicting files will be backed up here in
the case of accidental overwrites.

#### `/bin`

Executable scripts that will appear first in a user's `$PATH`.

#### `/rc`

Each script found in this directory will be executed during shell login.

#### `/init`

Contains scripts that should initialize certain platforms after the dotfiles
have been installed.

#### `/local`

Each script found in this directory will be executed during shell login after
the above `/rc` scripts. The only difference between these and the above
scripts are that these scripts are ignored from Git, so any sensitive
information won't accidentally be committed.

### Manual Steps

Due to automation limitations, some system provisioning steps must be completed
manually.

#### macOS

To configure macOS, run the `init/macos.sh` script.

#### Ubuntu

To configure Ubuntu, run the `init/ubuntu.sh` script.
